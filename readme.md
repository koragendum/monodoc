See `guide.html` for a description of the features that monodoc supports:<br>
https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/koragendum/monodoc/blob/main/guide.html

**Note** the guide is currently out of date and does not include documentation
for many new features. For example output, see https://expositor.dev; the source
for most pages can be seen by appending `.md` or replacing the `html` extension
with `md`.
